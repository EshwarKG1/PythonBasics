Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.
Climate change threatens people with food and water scarcity, increased flooding, extreme heat, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can be a result.
The World Health Organization calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.
Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. 
These include sea level rise, and warmer, more acidic oceans.
Many of these impacts are already felt at the current level of warming (1.2 째C). 
Additional warming will increase these impacts and may trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.
Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 째C".
However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 째C by the end of the century.
Limiting warming to 1.5 째C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
